## Shortly URL shortening API 
  A URL shortening landing page using React and shrtcode API.
  
  # Overview 
  This is app suggestion from [Frontent Mentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was a solitary project that allowed me implemnent an API and build something with real-world     several use cases. It was a mainly one-month project.
  
  Shortly is a url-shortening application which allowed me to use React and SCSS on the frontend while connecting it to the shrtcode API, which I enjoyed doing. I also liked         converting the design files into a nice responsive landing page, which help me to hone in on my UX skills while thinking in components. I also enjoyed diving into some new         aspects of JavaScript that I hadn't implemented before.
